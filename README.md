Urgent
--------
** Complete path Errors
* For python 2.6 users: Argparse inexistent
* Do the the destination more cleverly (For now: Infinite dumbness)

Cosmetic

* Add maxsize for copying (only)
* Copying instead of moving (?)

* Add Mimitype to Manual
* Add the help to Manual
* Give some details on how to conf in Manual
